# Sensor Map Vibe

This project demonstrates the vibe coding to make the basic sensor mapping application built with **Django** and **Leaflet**. It shows how to display a list of sensor devices on an interactive map and visualize sensor readings when a device is selected.

## Prompt Example for vibe coding
You can use nocode tools such as OpenAI codex, bubble, nocodefusion, flutterflow et al to make new project files or update with redesign using Copilot, Cursor tools after loading them. If you have experience the software development process, you can understand it's important to define requirements as the viewpoint of user goals, needs, interface, workflow considering technical framework, components like server side (flask, django), client side(bootstrap, flutter etc). Therefore, if you use vibe coding, your prompts should be as technically and terminologically detailed as you can without confusing the spec.
In example, to demonstrate the simple vibe coding how to create wep-based application including map, dashboard, I designed the simple UX sketches below to create the UI (User Interface) using Figma and give them to LLM.</br>
The prompts which I wrote are like below.
- OpenAI codex: Make project and files which have title called "sensor map vibe" using python, django, leaflet map, support to visualize sensor device PoI list on map, visualize sensor data chart when user click the PoI, connect and disconnect sensor device which has (device name, MAC address, position, device number, description, dataset fields) with example data.

- Github Copilot for map.html: Redesign and update this map.html consdering this pasted image. Use bootstrap library and style to make this UI and UX. Add resize handler to show the entire the map, charts components which are depending on browser screen size automatically, naturally. Font height = 11pt. Make PoI from Device and SensorData in models.py. Make these charts using bootstrap chart from Device and SensorData in models.py.

- Github Copilot for device_detail.html: Redesign and update this HTML consdering this pasted image. Use bootstrap library and style to make this UI and UX. Add resize handler to show the entire the map, charts components which are depending on browser screen size automatically, naturally. Font height = 11pt. Make PoI from Device and SensorData in models.py. Make these charts using bootstrap chart from Device and SensorData in models.py.
- GitHub Copilot to add click event: Add click event of Detail Sensor List menu and show the device_detail with device 1 when click it.

# Generated Result 
It generated the project files including UX like below.

# Lesson and Learn for vibe coding
- There is no right answer to how to develop the projects that satisfy the needs of various users in Vibe Coding. When you Vibe Coding, you will find that you have to predict the useful prompts of your LLM as if you are predicting the project template, folders, files, code routines that are generated variably.
- In fact, since the codes generated by LLM are the result of many statistical probabilities, it is not easy to predict the prompts required for your Vibe coding. What is certain is that ChatGPT, Google gemini, and Claude LLM-based agent models trained using a large amount of GitHub code, CoT, and ReAct training data will probabilistically generate project files and codes based on the prompts you enter. Therefore, all generated files and codes are probabilistically hung with technical terms, and you need to understand the relationship between these terms and codes to do Vibe coding. Ultimately, you need development experience.
Therefore, you should not believe what some people say that anyone can Vibe Coding without knowing anything about development or technology stack. It's not common sense.
- If you have no experience with the software development process, your vibe coding projects will likely end up being limited to things like calculators, simple games, and developing simple HTML pages. You can develop simple apps like this without them, but if you try to do something a little more complex, you'll soon find yourself stuck in a maze of code, unable to understand and fix errors or hallucinations in the generated project with code to make it work.

So, what should we prepare for vibe coding?
- Have experience in describing user requirements well in terms of technology stack and software engineering.
- Described user requirements in detail.
- UX should be provided in detail by sketching.
- Provide project templates included in the technology stack.
- Develop experience in eliminating illusions and errors.
- Start small. Do not try to complete all project files at once. LLM has clear token limits. You should vibe code gradually.
- Don't try to do everything in vibe coding. It's important to work efficiently. For example, you should be able to fix error codes yourself.
- Learn the features of each vibe coding, Nocode tool, and LLM and use them smartly. Some tools may understand UX sketches but not be able to generate projects, while others may generate project files and components but not be able to connect the detailed workflows between them.

# Features

- List of sensor devices with name, MAC address, position, device number and description.
- Interactive map with markers for each device using Leaflet.
- Line chart of sensor data powered by Chart.js when viewing a device.
- Ability to toggle a device's connection status.
- Example data provided via Django fixtures.

# Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Apply migrations and load example data:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py loaddata devices.json sensordata.json
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
   ```
4. Open `http://localhost:8000/` to see the map.

Run tests with:
```bash
python manage.py test
```
